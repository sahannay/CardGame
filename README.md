learning Typescript

Based on a paper written by Ken Slonneger in 2004 in which he describes a card game of War written in Java and intended to teach the concepts of object-oriented design. I translate into Javascript/Typescript along with many changes to the original code and structure of the objects. http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~slonnegr/oosd/22OOD.pdf.
